### Hi there, I'm Luiz Felipe 👋

I'm an engineer at Nextios. Previously I worked on @dadosgovbr, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) startups.

I've made contributions to @CKAN, @Wikimedia, @Mozilla, and other projects.

I'm currently maintaining the build, pipelines, and infrastructure of FarolCovid, a monitoring tool & simulation of the risk of collapse in Brazilian municipalities' health system due to Covid-19:
